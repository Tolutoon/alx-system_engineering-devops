# Postmortem
Learning how to write an Incident Report, also referred to as a Postmortem. This postmortem follows the guidelines used closely by google engineers to file reports. The report is made up of five parts, an issue summary, a timeline, root cause analysis, resolution and recovery, and lastly, corrective and preventative measures. Lets review each of these parts in detail.

### Issue Summary

- Short summary (5 sentences)
- List the duration along with start and end times (include timezone)
- State the impact (most user requests resulted in 500 errors, at peak 100%)
- Close with root cause

### Timeline

- List the timezone
- Covers the outage duration
- When outage began
- When staff was notified
- Actions, events, â€¦
- When service was restored

### Root Cause

- Give a detailed explanation of event
- Do not sugarcoat

### Resolution and recovery

- Give detailed explanation of actions taken (includes times)

### Corrective and Preventative Measures

- Itemized list of ways to prevent it from happening again
- What can we do better next time?
